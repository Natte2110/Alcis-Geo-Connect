This is a project for [Alcis Geo](https://www.alcis.org/) and aims to provide a centralised location for managing bespoke geospatial portals for Alcis customers. Utilising user logins both for Alcis Staff and their customers, each user of the site will have access to information and services pertinent to them.

The aim is to provide a simple and intuitive, yet interactive geospatial visualisation tool so that customers can get dynamic and interactive depictions of their relevant information wherever they are, and on whatever device they have at hand.

## Key Features:

- **Client-Specific Portals**: Provide each client with a dedicated portal tailored to their specific needs and projects, ensuring personalised access to relevant geospatial data and tools via user accounts.

- **Secure User Authentication**: Implement robust user authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access to client portals and protect sensitive/personal geospatial information.

- **Customisable Client Dashboards**: Enable clients to customise their dashboard views, allowing them to prioritise and access the most relevant data and analysis tools quickly.

- **Enriched Data Visualisation**: Interactive, data specific charts will enable clients to quickly visualise their most important data and make more efficient decisions.

- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implement role-based access control to manage staff access levels and permissions within the Alcis staff management system, ensuring appropriate data security and confidentiality.

- **Content Management System (CMS)**: Provide Alcis staff with a user-friendly CMS for managing and updating client portals, enabling seamless content publishing, data integration, and maintenance.

## Benefits:

- **Enhanced Client Collaboration**: Foster closer collaboration and communication with clients by providing them with dedicated portals for accessing geospatial data and collaborating with Alcis staff.

- **Increased Transparency**: Enhance transparency and accountability by providing clients with visibility into project progress, data updates, and analysis results through their dedicated portals.

- **Client Satisfaction**: Boost client satisfaction and loyalty by delivering a personalised and interactive user experience through the client portals, tailored to their specific needs and preferences.
